The Innovation Challenge is your chance to show your creativity and skills. You'll be tasked with creating an idea that will solve a global issue, build a basic prototype and then pitch it. It may sound daunting but no need to worry you will be guided through the process by accomplished mentors who have done it before. Additionally, the workshops happening throughout the week will help you pick up the technical skills needed and an exclusive pitching workshop just for competitors will give you the perfect pitch to win. 

The schedule for the Innovation Week is as follows:

| Day        | Event           | Location |  |

### What do I have to do?

TLDR; Participants should create an idea that can solve a Global Goal listed below. They should then create a prototype that represents the solution (eg. Mobile App Mockup or 3D Render of Product). They should then create a quick write up involving a summary of the project and how it solves the Global Issue. Based on this, they will present their work at a fair. The winner will be selected based on their pitch as well as the quality of their prototype.
