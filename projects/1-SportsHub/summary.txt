We are Team Sports Hub and we are hoping to solve the issue of sports teams not being able to field a complete eleven. Sports are very popular around the world but often teams can’t find enough players.This means that the teams have to forfeit, meaning that they automatically lose and the kids don’t get a chance to play sports.

Our app allows coaches to post potential opportunities for kids that do not currently play in a team. players who are looking for more game time to fill in for teams low on players. Players are able to browse opportunities and select those that they are more interested in. They can then use our built-in messenger function to chat with the coaches and arrange the final details.

For our eventual end product we will develop a Progressive Web App. This is due to the cost-effectiveness and the requirement to build only one app that will be optimised for all platforms. A PWA is an app built using web technologies that have additional code that allows it to act as a native app. For the backend of our app we will use Firebase’s database and messaging services. These are cost effective and reliable ways of implementing a database. To fund our app we will use Firebase’s built-in ad services.
